*------------ opC++ Compiler Installation ------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------*

Thank you for choosing opC++.  To install the opC++ 
Compiler on your Linux distribution, please follow the 
following steps:

1) Simply put this folder (opcpp/) in the installation 
   directory of your choice.  This is usually something 
   like /usr/bin/.
   
2) Make sure you set the permissions recursively 
   so that people can access the compiler and 
   the opC++ Standard Dialect.  You can do this 
   by using the chmod command:
   
   chmod -R go+rx opcpp/
   
3) Put the compiler executable in your path.  The 
   compiler is at opcpp/bin/linux32/release/opcpp.
   
4) If you have a license file, make sure it is named
   opC++.oplicense and place it in the same directory
   as the compiler executable.  If you do not do this,
   you can use the -license option on the compiler to
   specify the license location.  If this is a Beta
   build, the compiler will expire after a certain 
   time regardless of the license file.
