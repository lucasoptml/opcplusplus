Included in this archive is a tgz file called 
default.tgz.  It contains an empty default project.  
You can use this as a starting point.  You can add 
dialect code to dialect.doh, and opC++ code to 
code.oh.  To unzip, simply type the following:

	tar -xvf default.tgz

A makefile is included, and assumes that you have the 
g++ compiler installed.  If not, you may change it to
the C++ compiler of your choosing.

At the top of main.h and main.cpp, there are 
#include's that point to the generated code.  If you
change the name of the generated directory, you will 
have to update these #include's.

You can see all command line options available to the
compiler by typing the compiler name with no options.
